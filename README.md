# SonyMegatronReShade
Sony Megatron shader ported from Retroarch to ReShade 

To install add a ReShade effect search path to point to the root directory of this repository on your local hard disk. 

You will also need to place the preset ini files in the root directory of the game (unless anybody knows of a different way to get ReShade to read the presets).

This effect should be used in conjunction with my AutoHDR ReShade addon which can also be found on my GitHub site.
