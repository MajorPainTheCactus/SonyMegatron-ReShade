# SonyMegatronReShade
Sony Megatron shader ported from Retroarch to ReShade 

To install add a ReShade effect search path to point to the root directory of this repository on your local hard disk. 

This effect should be used in conjunction with my AutoHDR ReShade addon which can also be found on my GitHub site.
